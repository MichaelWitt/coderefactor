*Code Refactor.*

In this challenge we were tasked with the mission of taking existing code and refacting it to a more readable, organized, and clean html and css. I optimized the code by implementing semantic elements and adding applicable attributes and organization. 

Thanks for checking out my first project on the road to development!
